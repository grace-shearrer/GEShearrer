abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This cross-sectional study assesses the independent and combined effects of breastfeeding ({BF}) and dietary intake, specifically sugar-sweetened beverages ({\SSB}), on obesity prevalence in low-income, primarily Hispanic toddlers. {METHODS}: The following data were collected in 2011 via phone surveys with caregivers of 2295 low-income children (2-4 years) from Los Angeles County Women, Infants, and Children ({WIC}) programs: infant feeding, dietary intake, gestational diabetes status, birth weight, gestational age, and mother's {BMI}. {WIC} staff measured children's height and weight. Chi-square tests and binary logistic regressions assessed the independent and combined effects of {BF} and dietary intake on obesity prevalence. {RESULTS}: Compared to no {BF}, {BF} ≥ 12 mos was associated with a 47\% reduction in obesity prevalence ({AOR} = 0.53, 95\% {CI} 0.4-0.8, P = 0.004). Compared to 2 + {\SSB}/d, no {\SSB}/d intake was associated with a 28\% reduction in obesity prevalence ({AOR} = 0.72, 95\% {CI} 0.5-1.0, P = 0.03). High intake of soda, diet soda, and fruit drinks were linked to increases in obesity prevalence. There was no effect of 100\% juice, milk (plain or flavored) fruit, vegetable, fast food, or sweetened grain intake on obesity prevalence. {CONCLUSIONS}: These findings support encouragement of {BF} ≥ 12 mos and no {\SSB} intake to prevent obesity in low-income, primarily Hispanic, toddlers.

Partial correlations were estimated and analysis of covariance (ancova) models fit to examine the relationship among dietary variables, inflammation markers and adiposity measures with the following a priori covariates: Tanner stage, ethnicity, sex, total energy intake, total body fat and total lean mass. {RESULTS}: Inference based on ancova models showed that the highest tertile of fibre intake (mean intake of 21.3 ± 6.1 g d(-1) ) vs. the lowest tertile of fibre intake (mean intake of 7.4 ± 1.8 g d(-1) ) was associated with 36\% lower plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (P = 0.02) and 43\% lower resistin (P = 0.02), independent of covariates. Similar results were seen for insoluble fibre. No other dietary variables included in this study were associated with inflammation markers. {CONCLUSIONS}: These results suggest that increases in dietary fibre could play an important role in lowering inflammation and therefore metabolic disease risk in high-risk minority youth. \copyright 2015 World Obesity.}

The aim of this study was to examine this issue in more detail by assessing the relationship between eating frequency and adiposity and metabolic disease risk in a cohort of exclusively overweight Hispanic youth. {METHODS}: This analysis included 191 overweight (⩾ 85th percentile body mass index ({BMI})) Hispanic youth (8-18 years) with the following cross-sectional measures: height, weight, {BMI}, dietary intake via multiple 24 h recalls, body composition via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, lipids and insulin action (insulin sensitivity, acute insulin response ({AIR}) and disposition index, a measure of \beta-cell function) via a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Each eating occasion ({EO}) was defined as ⩾ 50 calories and ⩾ 15 min from any prior {EO}. Infrequent eaters ({IEs}) were classified as any subject who ate \textless 3 {EOs} on any dietary recall (n = 32), whereas frequent eaters ({FEs}) always consumed ⩾ 3 {EOs} (n = 159). {RESULTS}: Using analyses of covariance, {FEs} compared with {IEs} consumed 23\% more calories per day (P ⩽ 0.01), ate 40\% more often and consumed 19\% less calories per {EO} (P ⩽ 0.01). {FEs} also exhibited 9\% lower {BMI} Z-scores (P ⩽ 0.01), 9\% lower waist circumferences (P ⩽ 0.01), 29\% lower fasting insulin (P = 0.02), 31\% lower {HOMA}-{IR} (Homeostatic Model Assessment: Insulin Resistance) values (P = 0.02) and 19\% lower triglycerides (P ⩽ 0.01), as well as an 11\% higher {AIR} (P = 0.02) and 31\% higher disposition index (P=0.01). The following a priori covariates were included: Tanner, sex, body fat and reported energy intake. {CONCLUSION}: These findings suggest that increased eating frequency is related to decreased obesity and metabolic disease risk in overweight Hispanic youth, despite increases in energy intake.}

This study evaluates the relationship between dietary food intake at 6-9 weeks postpartum (baseline) and odds of substantial postpartum weight retention (≥ 5 kg) at 1-year in women with {GDM}. {METHODS}: The Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after {GDM} pregnancy ({SWIFT}) is a prospective multi-ethnic cohort (75\% minority) of 1035 women (aged 20-45 years) with recent {GDM} who delivered a singleton, live birth (≥35 weeks gestation) and underwent 2-h 75 g {OGTTs}, anthropometric measurements and other assessments at 6-9 weeks postpartum (baseline) and annually thereafter. Eight hundred and eighty-eight women without diabetes at baseline completed the 18-item {PrimeScreen} to assess dietary intake and the 13-item Caffeine Survey to assess beverage intake, and completed 1-year follow-up. Average postpartum weight retention was calculated (1-year postpartum weight minus pre-pregnancy weight). Multivariable logistic regression models that estimated baseline dietary intake and odds of substantial postpartum weight retention ({SPPWR} ≥5 kg above pre-pregnancy weight) versus not {SPPWR} adjusted for numerous clinical, sociodemographic and behavioral covariates. {RESULTS}: Compared to eating no fried foods, women who reported eating fried foods ≥5 servings/wk. (n = 32) and 2-4 serv/wk. (n = 208), respectively, had a three-fold and two-fold higher odds of {SPPWR} ({OR} = 3.38, 95\% {CI}:1.36-8.38, P = 0.009; {OR} = 1.99, 95\% {CI}:1.30-3.03, P = 0.02), after adjustment for covariates and other foods and soda intake. Soda intake ≥2 serv/wk. versus none was associated with higher odds of {SPPWR} ({OR} = 1.95, 95\% {CI}:1.22-3.11, P = 0.005) adjusted for fried foods and covariates, but was attenuated ({OR} = 1.61,95\% {CI}:0.98-2.66, p = 0.06) after addition of whole eggs and processed meats. {CONCLUSIONS}: These findings indicate that interventions should focus on reducing fried foods and soda intake during early postpartum periods to reduce substantial postpartum weight retention in high-risk women with {GDM}. {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: {NCT01967030}; October 2013, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Health and Human Development ({NICHD}).}

However, hedonic-motivated food intake, in particular consumption of highly rewarding foods, may act to override hemostatic signaling and contribute to overconsumption, weight gain, and obesity. Here, we review human neuroimaging literature that has delivered valuable insight into the neural correlates of hedonic-motivated ingestive behavior, weight gain, weight loss, and metabolic status. Our primary focus is the brain regions that are thought to encode aspects of food hedonics, gustatory and somatosensory processing, and executive functioning. Further, we discuss the variability of regional brain response as a function of obesity, weight gain, behavioral and surgical weight loss, as well as in type 2 diabetes.}

This study hypothesized that high versus low intakes of habitual {\SSBs} would result in greater hunger, decreased fullness, and a blunted gut hormone response, however the high versus low fiber group would exhibit decreased hunger and increased fullness. This was a randomized crossover feeding trial with 47 African American and Hispanic adolescents. The experiment included three 24-hour recalls to assess habitual dietary intake. During the test meal phase, subjects were served breakfast and lunch. During the ad libitum meal phase, subjects were fed an ad libitum dinner. During the test meal phase, blood was drawn every 30 minutes for 3 hours. During the ad libitum meal phase, hunger and fullness visual analogue scales were completed. For this analysis, subjects were grouped into the following habitual {\SSB} categories: low {\SSB} (≤1 {\SSB} serv/day), medium {\SSB} (\textgreater1 - \textless 2 serv/day), and high {\SSB} (≥2 serv/day). Fiber categories were created based on quartiles of intake. Mixed modeling was used to explore how {\SSB} and fiber categories predicted ghrelin/{PYY} values and hunger/fullness ratings across time within and between test meals. The following a priori covariates included: sex, ethnicity, age, and obesity status. The low {\SSB} group had higher fullness ratings over the ad libitum meal compared to the high {\SSB} group (\beta =-0.49, {CI}=(-0.89, -0.08), p=0.02) and higher ghrelin concentrations than the medium and high {\SSB} group over the test meal phase (\beta =-1.86, {CI}=(-2.81, -0.92), p\textless 0.01). Habitual {\SSB} intake appears to play a key role in moderating fullness responses possibly via ghrelin. Copyright \copyright 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: This pilot study developed techniques to perform Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI}) of specific fat deposition in 18 children (age 18 months to 4 years). {METHODS}: The children engaged in a series of practice tests to become acclimated to the scanner noises, reduce claustrophobia, and rehearse holding still for a set time. The practice tests assessed if the child could remain still for two minutes while watching a video, first while lying on a blanket, second, on the blanket with headphones, and third, in the mock scanner. The children who passed the three practice tests were then scanned with a {3T} Siemens Skyra magnet. Abdominal fat distribution (region of interest ({ROI}) from the top of the ileac crest to the bottom of the ribcage) volume was measured using 2-point {DIXON} technique. This region was chosen to give an indication of the body composition around the liver. {RESULTS}: Twelve out of eighteen participants successfully completed the actual {MRI} scan. Chi-squared test showed no significant difference between male and female pass-fail rates. The median age of completed scans was 36 months, whereas the median age for children unable to complete a scan was 28 months. The average total trunk fat was 240.9±85.{2mL} and the average total {VAT} was 37.7±25.{9mLand} liver fat was not quantifiable due to physiological motion. Several strategies (modeling, videos, and incentives) were identified to improve pediatric imaging in different age ranges. {CONCLUSION}: Using an age-specific and tailored protocol, we were able to successfully use {MRI} for fat imaging in a majority of young children. Development of such protocols enables researchers to better understand the etiology of fat deposition in young children, which can be used to aid in the prevention and treatment of adiposity.}

abstract = {Background: Children of overweight or obese parents are at a high risk of developing obesity. Objective: This study sought to examine the underlying neural factors related to parental obesity risk and the relative impact of sugar and fat when consuming a palatable food, as well as the impact of obesity risk status on brain response to appetizing food images. Design: With the use of functional {MRI}, the responses of 108 healthy-weight adolescents [mean ± {SD} body mass index (kg/m2): 20.9 ± 1.9; n = 53 who were at high risk by virtue of parental obesity status, n = 55 who were low risk] to food stimuli were examined. Stimuli included 4 milkshakes, which systematically varied in sugar and fat content, a calorie-free tasteless solution, and images of appetizing foods and glasses of water. Results: High-risk compared with low-risk adolescents showed greater blood oxygen-dependent response to milkshakes (all variants collapsed) compared with the tasteless solution in the primary gustatory and oral somatosensory cortices (P-family-wise error rate \textless  0.05), replicating a previous report. Notably, high-risk adolescents showed greater caudate, gustatory, and oral somatosensory responses to the high-sugar milkshake than to the tasteless solution; however, no effect of risk status was observed in the high-fat milkshake condition. Responses to food images were not related to obesity risk status. Conclusion: Collectively, the data presented here suggest that parental weight status is associated with greater striatal, gustatory, and somatosensory responses to palatable foods-in particular, high-sugar foods-in their adolescent offspring, which theoretically contributes to an increased risk of future overeating. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as {NCT01949636}.}

abstract = {Understanding weight-related differences in functional connectivity provides key insight into neurocognitive factors implicated in obesity. Here, we sampled three groups from human connectome project data: 1) 47 pairs of {BMI}-discordant twins (n = 94; average {BMI}-discordancy 6.7 ± 3.1 kg/m2), 2) 47 pairs of gender and {BMI} matched {BMI}-discordant, unrelated individuals, and 3) 47 pairs of {BMI}-similar twins, to test for body mass dependent differences in between network functional connectivity. Across {BMI} discordant samples, three networks appeared to be highly sensitive to weight status; specifically, a network comprised of gustatory processing regions, a visual processing network, and the default mode network ({DMN}). Further, in the {BMI}-discordant twin sample, twins with lower {BMI} had stronger connectivity between striatal/thalamic and prefrontal networks ({pFWE} = 0.04). We also observed that individuals with a higher {BMI} than their twin had stronger connectivity between cerebellar and insular networks ({pFWE} = 0.04). Connectivity patterns observed in the {BMI}-discordant twin sample were not seen in a {BMI}-similar sample, providing evidence that the results are specific to {BMI} discordance. Beyond the involvement of gustatory and visual networks and the {DMN}, little overlap in results were seen between the two {BMI}-discordant samples. In concordance with previous findings, we hypothesize that stronger cortical-striatal-thalamic connectivity associated with lower body mass in twins may facilitate increased regulation of hedonically motivated behaviors. In twins with higher body mass, increased cerebellar-insula connectivity may be associated with compromised satiation signaling, an interpretation dovetailing prior research. The lack of overlapping results between the two {BMI} discordant samples may be a function of higher study design sensitivity in the {BMI}-discordant twin sample, relative to the more generalizable results in the unrelated sample. These findings demonstrate that distinct connectivity patterns can represent weight variability, adding to mounting evidence that implicates atypical brain functioning with the accumulation and/or maintenance of elevated weight.

abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Type 2 diabetes ({T2D}) is associated with aberrant neural functioning; however, the point at which brain function alterations occur in the progression of {T2D} is unknown. Here, we tested for differences in functional connectivity in adults with prediabetes and healthy individuals. We hypothesized that prediabetes, defined by glycated hemoglobin ({HbA1c}) 5.7-6.4\% would be associated with disruptions in default mode network ({DMN}) connectivity. {METHODS}: Fourteen brain networks were tested in 88 adults (prediabetes: n = 44; {HbA1c} = 5.8±0.2\%; healthy: n = 44; {HbA1c} = 4.7±0.2\%) matched for sex, age, and {BMI}. {RESULTS}: We did not find differences in {DMN} connectivity between groups. Individuals with prediabetes showed stronger connectivity between the ventral attention network and (1) a visual network ({pFWE} = 0.0001); (2) a somatosensory network ({pFWE} = 0.0027). Individuals with healthy {HbA1c} showed stronger connectivity of the ventral attention network and (1) cingulo-opercular network ({pFWE}  =  0.002); (2) a thalamic-striatal-visual network ({pFWE} = 0.001). {CONCLUSIONS}: Relative to individuals with prediabetes, those with a healthy {HbA1c} showed stronger connectivity between brain networks underlying self-control and attention to stimuli. In contrast, those with prediabetes demonstrated stronger connectivity between brain networks associated with sensory and attention to stimuli. While {T2D} reported contribute to decreased {DMN} connectivity, prediabetes is characterized by a shift in functional connectivity from a self-control network towards increasing connectivity in sensory network.}
