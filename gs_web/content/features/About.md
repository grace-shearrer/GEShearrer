# All About Grace
## Who
I was born in Denver, Colorado and studied Nutrition/Physiology/Chemistry at the University of Wyoming. I moved south to Austin, Texas to complete my PhD in Nutritional Science at the University of Texas at Austin. 

## What
I am a nutritional scientist interested in the hepatic-brain axis. Never heard of the hepatic-brain axis? You aren't alone! I made it up, but I am not the only person studying it. I use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plasma derived endocrine factors (hormones), eyetracking, and behavioral experiments to study how people, especially vulnerable populations (women and children), develop insulin resistance.
