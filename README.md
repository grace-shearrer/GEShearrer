# Grace E Shearrer, PhD
Welcome! This is a personal website for Grace Shearrer (me). 

## Who?
As mentioned above my name is Grace Shearrer. I am a research assistant professor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. 

## What?
A research assistant professor. Essentially a professor that doesn't teach a lot, but also isn't tenure track. This is a great place for me now, as I am able to apply for my own grants and work on lots of projects. However, my **overall goal is to transition to tenure track**. 

## Where?
* Currently I work at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Located in.... Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  
* Previously I got my PhD in Nutritional Science at the University of Texas at Austin
*  Even further in the past, I got my BSFC (Bachelor of Family and Consumer Science) at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, WY.
* I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado 

## When?
I have been a research assistant professor for a little under a year. Before that I worked as a post doc for 3 years with Dr. Kyle Burger in NIBL lab. Before that I completed my PhD with Dr. Jaimie Davis in 2016, and finished my BSFC in 2012. 

My goal is to obtain tenure before 40. I have known I wanted to be tenure track professor since 2010. While at the University of Wyoming, I was working as an O Chem TA under Drs. Robert Corcoran and Bill Hoberg and completing undergrad research with Dr. Donal Skinner. At the time I was a pre-med student, however my experiences teaching O Chem and doing research made me realize my true passion was teaching and research! After that I turned my attention to doctoral programs rather than medical school. 

## Why?
As stated above, my extracurriculars in my undergraduate studies really focused my attention on becoming a professor out of a love of both teaching and research. As I have developed as a scientist I realize that there are a lot of reasons why I am a scientist, and why I want to be a tenure track professor:
* InsatCuriosity
* Problem solving
* Teamwork
* Representation
