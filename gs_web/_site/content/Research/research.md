# Research

My research covers a variety of topics ranging from Nutrition to Computer Science. The overall focus of my research is learning how the body and mind interact to produce behavior, specifically how the liver and brain interact to maintain homeostasis.

## Sugar intake in adolescents
A major theme of my work is the effect of sugar intake on metabolic, endocrine, and neural pathways in adolescents. Increased autonomy, rapid growth, and high availability of sugary foods highlight the adolescent period. With a combination of secondary data analysis from across the US, I have found that increased sugar intake is associated with increased visceral adiposity, higher cortisol awakening response, increased feelings of hunger, and decreased gut hormones ghrelin and PYY. In adolescents at high risk for weight gain by virtue of parental overweight or obese status, we found increased BOLD response in reward and gustatory regions compared to those at low risk to a high sugar beverage. Furthermore, those adolescents who were at high risk gained more weight at a 3 y follow up compared to the normal weight (see citation a above). In a slightly older group of college students, a high sugar meal (compared to fasted) was associated with increased connectivity between the oral somatosensory cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, drive/attention/motivation). Suggesting the brain increases communication between sensory regions and stimuli control regions with sugar intake. This may result in increased motivation to consume more sugar.  Overall, intake of sugar appears to promote further sugar intake and is related to unfavorable hormonal and metabolic profiles. Familial risk for obesity is associated with increased neural response to high sugar beverages associated and with increased weight gain, possibly putting the children of parents with high BMI at risk for overconsumption of sugar foods.

## Pregnancy and sugar intake
Pregnancy, and the postpartum period are critical stages of insulin resistance for the mother and development for the child. My work has shown that diet and gestational diabetes (GDM) effect both mother and child. Children who were breastfed, even if the mother had GDM, were less likely to be obese at age 4 compared to children who were not breastfed. This is particularly impactful as children of mothers with GDM are more likely to be overweight or obese, however breastfeeding appears to be protective. In the mothers, intake of sugar (in particular sugar sweetened beverages) appears to increase risk of weight retention in the postpartum period. Finally, in the first study of its kind, I found that postpartum weight does not present the same BOLD response to milkshake flavor as traditional weight gain from overeating. This suggests that postpartum weight may operate differently from traditional weight gain, and may require novel interventions.

## Puberty, dopamine, insulin resistance
I have begun to explore the relationship between puberty, insulin resistance, and the brain. Using pilot data from previous a previous task-based milkshake study, the Human Connectome Project (HCP), and the Adolescent Brain Cognition and Development (ABCD) study, I have found that the OFC, dlPFC, and precuneus are sensitive to both changes in glycemic control and pubertal status. These are brain regions associated with insulin resistance, the primary taste cortex, and decision making. A topological analysis of BMI status in adults roots these findings in a graphical state, showing elevated BMI is associated with increased integration of the somatosensory network (including the precuneus) and segregation of task control networks (including the OFC and dlPFC). Using the ABCD dataset (citation b in personal statement), I similarly found decreased connectivity between sensorimotor and task control networks (specifically the cingulo-opercular network) in adolescents with obesity compared to their normal weight peers. In the same cohort, mid-pubertal adolescents (pubertal development score (PDS)  3, no menarche) showed increased whole brain connectivity compared to early pubertal (PDS< 3 and no menarche) and late pubertal groups (PDS  7 and menarche). In an additional non-imaging dataset (citation c under personal statement), using data driven methods, testosterone levels, weight, and waist circumference explained most of the variation in self-reported pubertal status (pubertal development scale), whereas in boys self-reported voice change explained the most variation. Thus, testosterone, waist circumference, weight status, and voice change should be measured to validate self-reported pubertal status. Overall, these studies serve as both a contribution to science in general and provide pilot data for the present K01 application. Specifically, the precuneus, OFC, dlPFC appear to be sensitive to both glycemia and development, while network analyses show alterations in sensorimotor areas and task control brain regions with BMI status.
