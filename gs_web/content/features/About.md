# All About Grace
## Who
I was born in Denver, Colorado and studied Nutrition/Physiology/Chemistry at the University of Wyoming. I moved south to Austin, Texas to complete my PhD in Nutritional Science at the University of Texas at Austin. 

## What
I am a nutritional scientist interested in the hepatic-brain axis. Never heard of the hepatic-brain axis? You aren't alone! I made it up, but I am not the only person studying it. I use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plasma derived endocrine factors (hormones), eyetracking, and behavioral experiments to study how people, especially vulnerable populations (women and children), develop insulin resistance.  

## Why
Insulin resistance can develop into type 2 diabetes, an expensive and debilitating disease state. Increasing research indicates that peripheral insulin interacts with dopaminergic signaling in the brain. This is important because dopamine is important for encoding how we learn about rewards and punishments. Considering we primarily eat for rewarding purposes this draws the interesting question of: does what we eat influence our brain and body to eat more of it? 

## Where
Currently I am a researc
