Welcome! This is a personal website for Grace Shearrer (me). 

## Who?
As mentioned above my name is Grace Shearrer. I am a research assistant professor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. 

## What?
A research assistant professor. Essentially a professor that doesn't teach a lot, but also isn't tenure track. This is a great place for me now, as I am able to apply for my own grants and work on lots of projects. However, my maoverall goal is to transition to tenure track.
