I am a Research Assistant Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill working with Dr. Kyle Burger in the Neuropsychology of Ingestive Behavior Laboratory [NIBL](https://niblunc.org/) within the [Department of Nutrition](https://sph.unc.edu/nutr/unc-nutrition/).  I am currently developing my program of research and  actively designing my research group. 

My research interests revolve around the hepatic-brain axis specifically in 'special' insulin resistant populations (pregnant women, adolescents, Parkinson's). I completed my PhD in Nutritional Science at the University of Texas at Austin under the mentorship of Dr. Jaimie Davis in 2016. My graduate work focused on the impact of sugar sweetened beverage intake on neural, metabolic, and behavior in adolescents.  Extending this line of research into my post doc, I have found adolescents with overweight and obese parents were at greater risk of weight gain, and showed altered neural response to a high sugar beverage. In sum, showing adolescence is a critical time period for weight gain and altered metabolic factors, as if adolescence wasn't difficult enough. 

Through out my graduate and post doc work I have been honored as an endowed fellow in Nutrition at the University of Texas at Austin and an [Ethan Sims Young Investigator Award Finalist](https://2017.obesityweek.com/session/ethan-sims-award-session/) through the Obesity Society. 

### Current Research Projects and Interests:

* Puberty as model of transient insulin resistance to assess the importance of insulin on dopamine reward learning 
* Assessing the usefulness of topological measures to describe changes in functional neural organization
* Development of eating behaviors in toddlers (2-5y)
