Dating back nearly a decade, my program of work aims to understand how cognitive and physiological factors influence food intake and health. This complex problem requires multidisciplinary approaches. As such, my work frequently draws concepts from cognitive neuroscience and computer science to elucidate the relationship between the brain, behavior, endocrinology, and diet. Importantly, my work focuses on underrepresented populations at high risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D): children, adolescents, mothers, and the eldery. My work has examined the effect of sugar sweetened beverage intake on hunger and satiety, as well as on metabolic factors (visceral adipose accumulation, cortisol response, and endocrine function), and brain response showing that sugar sweetened beverage intake is associated with poor health in adolescents. Specifically, I found adolescents with overweight and obese parents are at increased risk of weight gain, and show altered neural response to a high sugar beverage. In sum, showing adolescence is a critical time period for weight gain and altered metabolic factors. This work has been recognized at the national Obesity Society meeting, as I was an Ethan Sims Young Investigator Award Finalist.

### Sugar intake in adolescents
Sugar intake on metabolic, endocrine, and neural pathways in adolescents Increased autonomy, rapid growth, and high availability of sugary foods highlight the adolescence. With a combination of secondary data analysis from across the US, I have found that increased sugar intake is associated with increased visceral adiposity, higher cortisol awakening response, increased feelings of hunger, and decreased gut hormones ghrelin and PYY. In adolescents at high risk for weight gain by virtue of parental overweight or obese status, we found increased BOLD response in reward and gustatory regions compared to those at low risk to a high sugar beverage. Furthermore, those adolescents who were at high risk gained more weight at a 3 y follow up compared to the normal weight. In a slightly older group of college students, a high sugar meal (compared to fasted) was associated with increased connectivity between the oral somatosensory cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, drive/attention/motivation). Thereby suggesting the brain increases communication between sensory regions and stimuli control regions with sugar intake. This may result in increased motivation to consume more sugar. Overall, intake of sugar appears to promote further sugar intake and is related to unfavorable hormonal and metabolic profiles. Familial risk for obesity is associated with increased neural response to high sugar beverages associated with increased weight gain, possibly putting the children of parents with high BMI at risk for overconsumption of sugar foods. I am currently studying the effect of bromocriptine on dopaminergic brain signaling and insulin status. Data will be complete in winter, 2019.

### Pregnancy, and the postpartum period are critical stages of insulin resistance for the mother and development for the child
My work has shown that diet and gestational diabetes (GDM) affect both mother and child. Children who were breastfed, even if the mother had GDM, were less likely to be obese at age 4 compared to children who were not breastfed. This is particularly impactful as children of mothers with GDM are more likely to be overweight or obese, however breastfeeding appears to be protective. In the mothers, intake of sugar (in particular sugar sweetened beverages) appears to increased risk of weight retention in the postpartum period. Finally, in the first study of its kind, I found that postpartum weight does not present the same BOLD response to milkshake flavor as traditional weight gain from overeating. This suggests that postpartum weight may operate differently from traditional weight gain, and may require novel interventions. I am currently a Co-I on the follow up to the Pregnancy, Eating, and Attitudes study (PEAS), SPROUTS. This contract with NICHD is following the children of the PEAS cohort over the years 3-5 years to examine how eating behaviors develop and the effect of early life environment. Data from this study will provide important insight into how eating behaviors develop and how this influences weight gain.

### The relationship between puberty, insulin resistance, and the brain
Using pilot data from previous a previous task-based milkshake study, the Human Connectome Project (HCP), and the Adolescent Brain Cognition and Development (ABCD) study, I have found that the OFC, dlPFC, and precuneus are sensitive to both changes in glycemic control and pubertal status. These are brain regions associated with insulin resistance, the primary taste cortex, and decision making. A topological analysis of BMI status in adults roots these findings in a graphical state, showing elevated BMI is associated with increased integration of the somatosensory network (including the precuneus) and segregation of task control networks (including the OFC and dlPFC). Using the ABCD dataset, I similarly found decreased connectivity between sensorimotor and task control networks (specifically the cingulo-opercular network) in adolescents with obesity compared to their normal weight peers. In the same cohort, mid-pubertal adolescents (pubertal development score (PDS) ≥ 3, no menarche) showed increased whole brain connectivity compared to early pubertal (PDS< 3 and no menarche) and late pubertal groups (PDS ≤ 7 and menarche). In an additional non-imaging dataset (citation c under personal statement), using data driven methods, testosterone levels, weight, and waist circumference explained most of the variation in self-reported pubertal status (pubertal development scale), whereas in boys self-reported voice change explained the most variation. Thus, testosterone, waist circumference, weight status, and voice change should be measured to validate self-reported pubertal status. I currently have a K01 under review exploring this subject matter.

### Exercise as a treatment for insulin resistance and cognitive impairment
By the year 2030, one in five United States adults will be older than age 65 y. With the increase in lifespan comes the concomitant increased risk of age-related diseases such as dementia and type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance and cognitive decline have been shown to be comorbid, however the temporal precedence is still unclear. Critically, interventions targeting cognitive decline, remain severely limited, and their ability to address co-morbidities is mostly unknown. Preclinical work in rodent models suggests that pro-diabetic lifestyles are associated with a breakdown in the blood brain barrier leading to neural inflammatory and immune responses resulting in cognitive impairment. This is in accordance with human research showing type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance trigger a cascade of aberrant physiology including: weakened microvascular structure, increased systemic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and advanced glycation end products. Currently, treatment for cognitive decline, irrespective of its etiology, has focused on pharmacological intervention. Non-pharmacological interventions, however, offer an attractive alternative in older adults, given their cost effectiveness, reduced risk of drug-drug interactions, and in particular their ability to address multiple comorbidities. A simple yet effective intervention with potentially profound outcome for age-related cognitive decline is physical exercise (PE). Combination of aerobic and resistance exercise have been shown to improve hemoglobin glycation, insulin resistance, and serum glucose, while even low intensity aerobic activity improves endothelial function. Concurrently, studies have shown that PE slows cognitive decline, and results- when applied as an intervention- in favorable changes in neurocognitive function, particularly in memory, processing speed and executive function.
