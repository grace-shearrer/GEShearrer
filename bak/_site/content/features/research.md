# Post Doctoral Research

I completed my post doctoral training under the guidance of Dr. Kyle Burger in 2019. The focus of my post doctoral work was honing my neuroimaging skills, learning how to run a drug trial, and developing my grant writing and management skills.


## SPROUTS: a follow up to the PEAS study 2018-2022
This is a follow up to the PEAS study. In the initial PEAS study the focus was on the mother and how her health behaviors impacted weight gain in pregnancy and weight retention in the postpartum period. SPROUTS is focused on the children of these mothers, following them from ages 2-6 y to study how eating behaviors develop in early childhood. This study is actively collecting data on a number of metrics including: implicit bias to food images, impulsivity, executive control, eating in the absence of hunger, food neophobia, and general dietary intake.

## Pregnancy Eating Attitudes Study (PEAS)
PEAS is an observational study of women who were pregnant in North Carolina. This study followed a cohort of women from 12-weeks pregnancy, through 2 y postpartum. The focus of this study was to explore how women eat during pregnancy, and what factors put them at risk for excess weight gain and excess postpartum weight retention. Dr. Burger and I developed a unique neuroimaging experiment in a subset of this sample. Lovingly called "Sugar Mama", this substudy looked at the effect of a highly palatable, high sugar milkshake on BOLD response in the mothers at 6 months postpartum. I also developed a probabalistic taste prediction error paradigm to assess classical conditioning in a population that had to gain weight (aka pregnancy). I found that the response to the prediction error paradigm was unique from traditional weight gain (due to overeating or lack of energy expenditure). Overall, this is a positive results, suggesting the weight gained in pregnancy may not lead to the behavioral differences seen in obesity.
