## Who?
As mentioned above my name is Grace Shearrer. I am a research assistant professor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. 

## What?
A research assistant professor. Essentially a professor that doesn't teach a lot, but also isn't tenure track. This is a great place for me now, as I am able to apply for my own grants and work on lots of projects. However, my **overall goal is to transition to tenure track**. 

## Where?
* Currently I work in the [Department of Nutrition](https://sph.unc.edu/nutr/unc-nutrition/) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Located in.... Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  
* Previously I got my PhD in Nutritional Science at the University of Texas at Austin
*  Even further in the past, I got my BSFC (Bachelor of Family and Consumer Science) at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, WY.
* I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado 

## When?
I have been a research assistant professor for a little under a year. Before that I worked as a post doc for 3 years with Dr. Kyle Burger in  the Neuropsychology of Ingestive Behavior Laboratory [NIBL](https://niblunc.org/) NIBL lab. Before that I completed my PhD with Dr. Jaimie Davis in 2016, and finished my BSFC in 2012. 

My goal is to obtain tenure before 40. I have known I wanted to be tenure track professor since 2010. While at the University of Wyoming, I was working as an O Chem TA under Drs. Robert Corcoran and Bill Hoberg and completing undergrad research with Dr. Donal Skinner. At the time I was a pre-med student, however my experiences teaching O Chem and doing research made me realize my true passion was teaching and research! After that I turned my attention to doctoral programs rather than medical school. 

## Why?
As stated above, my extracurriculars in my undergraduate studies really focused my attention on becoming a professor out of a love of both teaching and research. As I have developed as a scientist I realize that there are a lotBooks with Jupyter and Jekyll

<img src="https://circleci.com/gh/jupyter/jupyter-book.svg?style=svg" class="left">

Jupyter Books lets you build an online book using a collection of Jupyter Notebooks
and Markdown files. Its output is similar to the excellent [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) tool,
and adds extra functionality for people running a Jupyter stack.

For an example of a book built with Jupyter Books, see the [textbook for Data 100](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/) at UC Berkeley.

Here are a few features of Jupyter Books

* All course content is written in markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, stored in `notebooks/`
* The Jupyter Book repo comes packaged with helper scripts to convert these into Jekyll pages (in `scripts/`) that can be hosted for free on GitHub
* Pages can have [Binder](https://mybinder.org) or JupyterHub links automatically added for interactivity.
* The website itself is based on Jekyll, and is highly extensible and can be freely-hosted on GitHub.
* There are a lots of reasons why I am a scientist, and why I want to be a tenure track professor:
* Insatiable Curiosity
* Desire to Problem Solve
* Need to Work in a Team
* Increase Representation 
### Curiosity
When I was in high school, I thought I was going to be a journalist. To teen Gracenifty HTML features under-the-hood, such as Turbolinks fast-navigation and
  click-to-copy in code cells.

## Getting started

To get started, jyournalism gave may natural curiosity an outlet in the world didactic learnbe interested in the following lin high school. In doing undergraduatks.
Here aresearch, I realized I could directly test my curiosity rather than just report on it. To this day, the desire to learn and understand the world around and in me motivates my research.
### Problem Solving
During my graduate work, a a few links of interest:

* **[Quickstart](features/features)** is a quick demo and overview of Jupyter Books.

* **[The Jupyter Book Guide](guide/01_overview)**
  will step you through the profcessor handed me a Python script for my dissertation work. Up to this point I was under the impression that this had something to do with snakes. I was terrified to learn that it wasn't a theatrical production for a snak of configuring and building your own Jupyter Book.

* **[The Jupyter Book template repo](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book)** is the template
  repository you'll use based musical, but rather a computer program I was supposed to edit and make work. Little did I know that this would actually become an integral part of my research. Programming analyses, paradigms, websites, etc, presented me with a puzzle. After enough research, learning, and asking questions I was able to solve my graduate dissertation script. Today, I believe firm knowledge in basic computer programming is essential for scientists and a great way to flex problem solving muscles.
### Teamwork
I have played soccer longer than I have been able to read. So, understandably, teamwork has been a big part of my life. Science is a lot like soccer. You can't have a team of goal scorers or a team of goalies. The best teams have deep rosters and everyone working towards a common goal. Science is similar. Laboratories need a variety of people working towards a similar goal. 
### Representation
This is pretty straight forward. Right now most positions in STEM are held by people of a very similar background. However, as stated above, the best teams/labs have a variety of skills and these skills are developed through different experiences. An unyielding goal of lab is to be and perform Open Science. This means not only open methods, open, open data, and preregistration, but also:
* Open to all people
* Open to all ability levels
* Open regardless of Socio-Economic-Status a start for your Jupyter Book.

* **A demo of the Jupyter Book** can be browsed via the sidebar to the left.

## Installation

Here's a brief rundown of how to create your own Jupyter Book using this site. For a more
complete guide, see [the Jupyter Book guide](guide/01_overview).

* Fork the Jupyter Book template repo
* Replace the demo notebooks in `content/` with your own notebooks and markdown files.
* Create a Table of Contents yaml file by editing `_data/toc.yaml`.
* Generate the Jekyll markdown for your notebooks by running `scripts/generate_book.py`
* Push your changes to GitHub (or wherever you host your site)!
