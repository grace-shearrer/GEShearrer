# Grace E Shearrer, PhD
Welcome! This is a personal website for Grace Shearrer (me). 

## Who?
As mentioned above my name is Grace Shearrer. I am a research assistant professor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. 

## What?
A research assistant professor. Essentially a professor that doesn't teach a lot, but also isn't tenure track. This is a great place for me now, as I am able to apply for my own grants and work on lots of projects. However, my **overall goal is to transition to tenure track**. 

## Where?
* Currently I work at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Located in.... Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  
* Previously I got my PhD in Nutritional Science at the University of Texas at Austin
*  Even further in the past, I got my BSFC (Bachelor of Family and Consumer Science) at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, WY.
* I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado 

## When?
I have been a research assistant professor for a little under a year. Before that I worked as a post doc for 3 years with Dr. Kyle Burger in NIBL lab. Before that I completed my PhD with Dr. Jaimie Davis in 2016, and finished my BSFC in 2012. 

My goal is to obtain tenure before 40. I have known I wanted to be tenure track professor since 2010. While at the University of Wyoming, I was working as an O Chem TA under Drs. Robert Corcoran and Bill Hoberg and completing undergrad research with Dr. Donal Skinner. At the time I was a pre-med student, however my experiences teaching O Chem and doing research made me realize my true passion was teaching and research! After that I turned my attention to doctoral programs rather than medical school. 

## Why?
As stated above, my extracurriculars in my undergraduate studies really focused my attention on becoming a professor out of a love of both teaching and research. As I have developed as a scientist I realize that there are a lot of reasons why I am a scientist, and why I want to be a tenure track professor:
* Insatiable Curiosity
* Desire to Problem Solve
* Need to Work in a Team
* Increase Representation 
### Curiosity
When I was in high school, I thought I was going to be a journalist. To teen Grace, journalism gave my natural curiosity an outlet in the world didactic learning in high school. In doing undergraduate research, I realized I could directly test my curiosity rather than just report on it. To this day, the desire to learn and understand the world around and in me motivates my research.
### Problem Solving
During my graduate work, a professor handed me a Python script for my dissertation work. Up to this point I was under the impression that this had something to do with snakes. I was terrified to learn that it wasn't a theatrical production for a snake based musical, but rather a computer program I was supposed to edit and make work. Little did I know that this would actually become an integral part of my research. Programming analyses, paradigms, websites, etc, presented me with a puzzle. After enough research, learning, and asking questions I was able to solve my graduate dissertation script. Today, I believe firm knowledge in basic computer programming is essential for scientists and a great way to flex problem solving muscles.
### Teamwork
I have played soccer longer than I have been able to read. So, understandably, teamwork has been a big part of my life. Science is a lot like soccer. You can't have a team of goal scorers or a team of goalies. The best teams have deep rosters and everyone working towards a common goal. Science is similar. Laboratories need a variety of people working towards a similar goal.
